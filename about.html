        <h1>More About Me</h1>
        <p>
          My name is <strong>Ronny Majakwe</strong>, born and raised in the heart of <strong>Northern Cape, South Africa</strong>. I'm currently pursuing a <strong>Diploma in ICT in Application Development</strong> at Walter Sisulu University, Buffalo City Campus.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am deeply passionate about Web Development, Data Science, and the opportunities brought by the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). I believe technology is a powerful tool for change, and I am committed to using it to build impactful solutions for society.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through web development, I enjoy creating interactive, user-friendly platforms that address real-world needs. My interest in data science has equipped me with the ability to analyze complex information, extract meaningful insights, and support data-driven decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am also enthusiastic about 4IR technologies such as AI, IoT, and automation, as I believe they are the future drivers of innovation and economic growth in Africa and beyond.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond my technical interests, I am a well-rounded individual with strong leadership and counseling skills. I take pride in supporting others through mentorship, teamwork, and emotional guidance. As a public speaker and designer, I enjoy communicating ideas clearly and creatively.
        </p>
        <p>
          My moral foundation is rooted in empathy, integrity, and service—qualities that help me connect with people and drive positive change. Whether it's through tech or human interaction, I’m passionate about using my skills to uplift others and create meaningful impact.
